%Train a new network and create a ghost of the network at 0% of the training process,
%5% training, 15% training, 30% training,60% training, and 100% training.
%Produce contrast, noise and rotation profiles using the trained (and untrained) neural
%networks. Show the graph and then ask the user if they wish to save the
%file, and under which name. Save the file as jpg in a subfolder called output.
%In the case of noise_profile visualization, visualize the evolution of the
%network for each of the ghost networks
